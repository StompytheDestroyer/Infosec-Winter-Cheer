The Twelve Days of Code Freeze (To the tune of 12 Days of Christmas)

On the 12th Day of Code Freeze Engineering gave to me:
12 Emergency Patches
11 Jira Tickets
10 Rollbacks
9  Unwanted “Features”
8  Missed Deadlines
7  Schema Changes
6  Unhashed Passwords
WAIT  When did that go live?????
4  Regression Errors
3  New Bugs
2  Committed Passwords
1  A pile of bad PHP
