To the tune of Hark the Herald Angels
Lyrics by The Ostrich and Stompy the Destroyer

Hark the Dreaded Phone call Ring
Brian Krebs has found something
Russian Hackers in your box
All your data has been doxxed

60 minutes on the phone
Asking you to de-fine ‘pwn’
Notification you must send
Class act litigation pends

Call out all your GIAC Crew
Document how you got screwed
While containment is your aim
Find somewhere to place the blame

Anonymous is now your friend
speaking out on CNN
If North Korea Claims the hack,
your stock price will soon bounce back.
