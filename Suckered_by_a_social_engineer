To the Tune of Winter Wonderland

There’s a virus hidin’ in the network
In between the backups and the cache
If you open up the wrong file
You’ll end up with a massive crash

On the ‘net
someone’s wishin
that you’ll fall 
for their phishin’

An obvious scam
that should have been spam
suckered by a 
social engineer
