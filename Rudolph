To the Tune of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer

Thereâ€™s shell shock and heartbleed
and venom and poodle
Logjam and firesheep round out the kaboodle  

But do you recall the most pervasive vulnerability of them all

Rudolph the Bad Password Chooser
Liked to use his kids first name (Rudolph Jr!)
And when he had to change it
His encryption scheme was lame (ROT13)
Then when he added numbers
To the nickname of his cat (Snowball7)
They never told poor Rudolph
John the Ripper thought of that. (Rainbow Tables)
